-----------------------------------------------------

QuokkADB is a re-branding of the adbuino code for Rabbit Hole Computing, 
LLC and adds support for the RP2040 microcontroller.

There are many copies of the adbuino code floating around. The original
copy is intended to live at:
    https://github.com/akuker/adbuino

Original ADBuino project was developed by Rob Braun to include a PS/2 interface:
    http://synack.net/~bbraun/   and    http://synack.net/svn/adbduino/
Difugue made additional updates for PS/2

-----------------------------------------------------

The ADB code is mostly derived from: https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard
(https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/blob/master/tmk_core/protocol/adb.c)
It was originally ADB host, and was adapted for device use by bbraun. 
Below is the license and credit for the original ADB host implementation.
